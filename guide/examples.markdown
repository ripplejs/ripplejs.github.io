Here are a few examples based on example code from React, Vue and Ractive
to give you an idea of how they compare.

Note that each of these examples are using the standalone version because
jsfiddle doesn't support Component. They're also using templates within the
HTML. This generally isn't recommended. You should use Component/Browserify
to load templates rather than scattering them in your HTML.
